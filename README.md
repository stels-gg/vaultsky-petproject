# VaultSky

VaultSky is a web-based project aimed at providing a cloud storage solution for securely storing and managing data.

## Description

What I'm doing isn't anything new or grandiose. I'm creating this project primarily for myself, to accelerate my understanding of web development and to avoid getting stuck while learning JavaScript, databases, and CSS styling.

If you've stumbled upon this, it's exciting that you ended up here! Feel free to download my repository and take a look at what I've put together with my still-developing skills. I'd appreciate any advice on how I can improve my code, optimize the site, or anything else you might suggest. I'll be more than happy to hear from you.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Maybe more in the future

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## Future Plans

For now, I'm just focusing on creating the basic structure and appearance of the website. In the long run, I plan to set up a database, possibly implement user authentication and authorization, develop a secure backend for handling file storage and management, and add more features like file sharing, folder organization, and more.
